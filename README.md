# Fallout 4 Interface
This repository provides user interface source files for Fallout 4 mod authors.
These source files are edited by Adobe Flash software to publish swf files used by the game.
Though the sources have been reconstructed in certain areas, the files here are intended to represent the vanilla interface as closely as possible, **including the vanilla bugs**!

The current [version](VERSION.md) information for this branch.


# Permissions
You may use the vanilla source files in your mod **without explicit permission**. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).
